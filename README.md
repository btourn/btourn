- 👋 Hi, I am Benjamin (@btourn) from Argentina. I am a Mechanical Engineer graduated from the [National Technological University](https://www.frsf.utn.edu.ar/), and also I have recently achieved a Ph. D. in Computational Mechanics from the [National University of the Littoral](http://www.fich.unl.edu.ar/). My thesis work is about the development of computational tools (mainly via inverse problems) to assist the heat treatment process of austempering of ductile iron parts. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuKyqQtc8pk) is the link to my dissertation.
- 📚 My areas of expertise are: numerical methods, inverse problems, numerical optimization, machine learning, and data science. 
- 🌱 I am currently enrolled in the [Artificial Intelligence Specialization program](https://lse.posgrados.fi.uba.ar/posgrados/especializaciones/inteligencia-artificial) from the [National University of Buenos Aires](https://www.uba.ar/), where I am getting into very interesting stuff about machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, natural language processing, among other topcis. 
- 👀 I am working on Physics-Informed Machine Learning methods for heat transfer engineering problems
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate on projects related to the fields mentioned above.
